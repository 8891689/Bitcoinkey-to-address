# Bitcoinkey-to-address
This C language tool can generate public keys from Bitcoin private keys and generate multiple address formats including P2PKH, P2SH and SegWit. It uses efficient and secure cryptography and encoding algorithms and supports hexadecimal and WIF format private keys.

## üìå Project Overview

This tool provides functionality for:

- Generating public keys from private keys (in hexadecimal or WIF format).
- Generating various types of Bitcoin addresses from public keys.

## üîë Private Key Handling

-   **WIF Generation:** Supports generating WIF format private keys from hexadecimal private keys.
-   **WIF Decoding:** Supports decoding WIF format private keys into hexadecimal private keys, and determining if it is in compressed format.
-   **Automatic Format Detection:** Automatically identifies the input private key format (hexadecimal or WIF).

## üîì Public Key Generation

-   **Elliptic Curve:** Generates public keys from private keys based on the secp256k1 elliptic curve algorithm.
-   **Compressed & Uncompressed:** Supports generating both compressed and uncompressed format public keys.

## üìÆ Address Generation

Supports generating the following types of Bitcoin addresses:

-   **P2PKH (Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash):** Traditional address, starts with `1`.
-   **P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash):** Multi-signature or script address, starts with `3`.
-  **P2SH-P2WPKH (P2SH wrapped P2WPKH):** P2SH wrapped Segregated Witness address, starts with `3`
-   **Bech32 (SegWit):** Segregated Witness address, starts with `bc1`.
-   **Bech32m (Taproot):** Taproot address, starts with `bc1p`.
-   **P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash):** Segregated Witness script address, starts with `bc1`.
-  **P2WSH-P2WPKH (P2WSH wrapped P2WPKH):** P2WSH wrapped Segregated Witness address, starts with `bc1`.

-   **Compressed/Uncompressed Support:** Supports generating addresses from both compressed and uncompressed public keys.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

-   **GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library):** Used for large number arithmetic.

### Custom Modules:

-  ** `ripemd160`
-  ** `base58`
-  ** `bech32`
-  ** `ecc`
-  ** `customutil`
-  ** `sha256`

## üî® Compilation and Installation

**1. Install dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian:**
-
```sh
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libssl-dev
```

Markdown
2. Compile the code:
```sh
gcc -O3 -o key key.c sha256/sha256.c base58/base58.c bech32/bech32.c ripemd160/ripemd160.c ecc/ecc.c customutil/customutil.c -lgmp
```

or
```sh
make
```

###üöÄ Usage
After successful compilation, you can run the tool from the command line, passing the private key (hexadecimal or WIF format) as an argument:
-
```sh

./key <Private Key (Hex or WIF)>

```
### Example
Input hexadecimal private key
```sh

./key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001

```
Output:
```sh
**Raw Private Key (Hex): 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
